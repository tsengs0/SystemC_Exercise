1. sc_clock cannnot be ported to sc_in< sc_uint<1> >, instead sc_in<bool>
2. The g++ option "-std=c++11" will incur some linker problems
3. wait() is only allowed in SC_THREADs and SC_CTHREADs; in SC_METHODs use next_trigger() instead
4. The initialisation of input or output port, i.e., sc_in and sc_out, must not be performed berfore the constructor.
